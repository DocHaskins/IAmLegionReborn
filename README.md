- Improved detection for screamers, the target is now at the players location, not the vanilla screamers feet (fixes so much for intensity)
- Mini-chase system added back to the volatiles, if a volatile spots you in Survivor and Ultimate versions they have a chance to call for more volatiles (RUN).
- Fix for Spitters not being able to target the player
- Fix for Banshees getting stuck in patrol, not attacking humans and player
- Fix for "Blue" viral glitch

HOTFIXES (1.0d)
- Updated to work with 1.4.0c

- Fixes for Syntax errors with collectables
- Fixes for missing loot from update
- Updated the Hive spawns modified back in Feb, 2022 to better reflect the current status of the game. This will probably need more balancing.
- Fix for Humans reacting to kicks, vaults, grapple
- Fix for dodge on humans happening too often
- Fix for volatile logic and attack patterns
- Fix for values error happening due to changed value types, causing the configuration to feed in the wrong type of values. Removed the values for now, configuration update is coming soon.
